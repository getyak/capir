# Design log

## 2026-10-20 — Web and macOS craft session

Work window: 00:36–12:00 Asia/Shanghai. New implementation stops at 11:30.

The surface is the signed-in personal workspace: resume a conversation, find a person, understand today's unfinished work, and review time. Content and the next useful action lead; utility chrome remains secondary. Business logic, records, and feature availability remain outside this session's changes.

Baseline source: remote main `1c7c9891`; resident Web `20c0d64a`; macOS uses the same resident workspace inside AppKit. See [active plan](plans/2026-10-20-design-noon.md) for evidence locations and verification state.

### Reference criteria

- [Ambi](https://www.ambi.ai/en): restrained composition and quiet chrome.
- [Linear](https://linear.app): precise alignment and information density.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.com/product): content priority and subtle separation.
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/): native window rhythm and clear task hierarchy.

Reference parity is a visual judgment, never established by passing functional tests alone.

### Pending decisions

No structural change is approved by this log. Candidates discovered during inspection will be recorded here before implementation.

### Loop 0 — baseline inspection (in progress)

The conversation canvas is already calm, with a single composer and secondary prompts. The installed macOS app initially shows an expired-session recovery state. The shared Web workspace is the primary opportunity to improve both platforms consistently.
